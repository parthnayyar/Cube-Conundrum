## About the Game
This is a 3-D puzzle game where the player must get the red and blue cubes to roll into their respective final positions. These cubes and their final positions will be on an elevated platform, and the player must use the directional arrow keys on the keyboard to roll over these cubes simultaneously, while using the fixed black cubes on the platform to their advantage. If either one of the red or blue box falls off the platform, the player loses. The player progresses to the next level when both the red and blue cubes are simultaneously in their final positions.

## Controls
